# gesturedrive_ML5
Controlling a basic JS based car driving game using gestures (input from webcam)
The training was performed using ML5.js which uses a pre-trained mobilenet model for transfer learning, thus making it easy to train on new data. The whole model is run on the browser, no image data gets sent anywhere else.
